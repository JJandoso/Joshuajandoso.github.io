                    <h3 id="hello-world">Hey there! </h3>
                    <p> Welcome to my profile, as you might have guessed my name is Joshua. A little about myself, I'm an american currently living in Brazil while pursuing my bachellors degree. At the moment i'm studying and bettering myself so that i can pursue a carrer as an full-stack developer and in the near future pursue a masters degree in IT. I work with respect, efficiency and above that charisma. Thats why i'm always willing to learn and adapt to new challenges in life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have already worked in the mechanical engineering area as an intern in the maintenance sector, where I was responsible for adopting preventive and corretive action on heavy machinery while gathering data to determine future actions on the equipmment based on their history. I have also worked as an intern in the aciliary sector of an offshore company focused on oil and gas extration, while there i was part of a team of engineers responsible of using softwares such as Solidworks and AutoCad to make aciliary drawings as requested by the company.
My goal currently is to get my first opportunity as a Junior Full-Stack Developer and thats why I study programing. At the moment I'm on my ninth semester in my Mechanical Engineering Bachelors degree and i have several other degrees in the engineering area but I found programming to be my passion and thats why im pursuing this dream of being a programmer.
